My IA project.

## What is this?
It's meant to be an MUN conference management app.

**NOTE:** This is just the JavaFX front-end. The back-end is written as a separate library, and has a different repo. It was originally meant to be in Kotlin as an excuse for me to learn Kotlin, but the idea got shot down by my teacher üôÅ (I might still continue working on the Kotlin one though, outside my IA).

The repo with the Java backend is at [quantomistro/ibia-core-java](https://github.com/quantomistro/ibia-core-java).

## Installation
I plan on finding a way to package it up into native executables for windows and macOS, but that'll probably be a while.
Until then, I'll try to release standalone jars (as long as I don't forget about it) which you can just run if you've got JRE on your system.

## Building from source
This project is built with gradle. Clone the repo, execute the `gradlew` script, and then run the task `gradlew build` to build the project, and `gradlew run` to run it.

Run `gradlew tasks` to view a list of all available gradle tasks.

No contributions! It's a graded school assignment! üòÆ
